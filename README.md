🕰️ A clock is a device designed to measure, display, and keep track of time. Its function is both practical and symbolic—a constant reminder of the passing moments, guiding our daily routines and connecting us with the rhythm of life.

Here’s a richer look at its features and significance:

⏱️ Core Components:
Face/Dial: Typically circular, marked with numbers or indices representing hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds.

Hands: Move around the dial—short for hours, long for minutes, and a thin one for seconds.

Mechanism: Can be mechanical, quartz, or digital—responsible for keeping time accurately.

Casing: Protective shell, often designed with aesthetic appeal, from sleek modern designs to ornate antique styles.
